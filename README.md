# CS Academy Scripts & Userscripts
Hey there. I decided to make some useful userscripts and scripts avaliable on github for ease of access and *educational purposes.*

## How to install/use these userscripts
**OPTION 1: IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CHROME EXTENSIONS**
1. Download/install a userscript extension of your choice.  
Example: Tampermonkey
- Google Chrome: [Google Chrome Install Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
- Opera: [Opera Install Link](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
- Microsoft Edge: [Edge Install Link](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
- Safari: [Safari Install Link](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1482490089?mt=8)

2. Create a new userscript  
Click on new userscript on the extension, and copy and paste a desired script from the scripts folder into the editor.  
*Alternatively*, you can install them without any copying from my [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1242102-dionednrg).
- create new script..
- copy all.

3. Enable/save the script  
Ctrl-S/Turn on the script to allow the extension to inject the js in the browser.  
Use this link [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg) to get started and learn more.

*If the extension is BLOCKED*: you can try to load as packed/unpacked manually from the [tampermonkey github](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey).  
To find out how to do that, go over to [load unpacked extensions](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/load-unpacked-extensions-000005962).  
  
**OPTION 2: NO ACCESS TO EXTENSIONS**  
*Option 1:* Without access to extensions, you can **copy and paste** the code into the javascript console in your browser(but wait!!).  
  
*Option 2:* There's a better way to do it without installing anything (only in google chrome) called **snippets**. They are essentially just codes of javascript that you can save and chrome automatically loads them each time you visit that specific website.  
Learn more and how to install [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets) + [useful stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9731965/is-there-a-way-to-create-and-run-javascript-in-chrome).
  
*Option 3:* Using **bookmarklets**, which are just bookmarked links that can contain the javascript code in the scripts directory, simply by writing ```javascript:(script content goes here)``` and saving it as a browser extension in your bookmarks.  
See more and discover how to use them [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/).
